### Model Support
# This application supports all GGUF format models. Some recommended models:

#- Small & Fast: TinyLlama, Phi-2, Qwen-1.8B

#- Balanced: Llama-2-7B, Mistral-7B, DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B

#- Powerful: Llama-2-13B, CodeLlama-13B, Qwen-14B

### System Requirements
#RAM: 8GB+ (16GB recommended for larger models)

#Storage: 2GB+ for models

#OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux

# Python: 3.8+

### Privacy & Security
- 🔒 No data leaves your computer

- 🔒 No API keys required

- 🔒 Complete control over your data

- 🔒 Models run locally on your hardware

### Usage
# Load a Model: Select and load a GGUF model from the sidebar

# Start Chatting: Type your message and press Enter

# Upload Documents: Drag and drop PDFs, images, or text files

# Branch Conversations: Create new conversation branches at any point

# JSON Mode: Constrain responses to specific JSON schemas

### Troubleshooting
# Common Issues
# "No models found": Download models using the download script

# Slow responses: Use smaller quantized models (Q4_K_M or smaller)

# Memory issues: Close other applications or use smaller models

### Getting Help
# Check the console output for detailed error messages. Most issues can be resolved by:

# Ensuring models are in the models/ directory

# Installing all Python dependencies

# Having sufficient RAM and storage
